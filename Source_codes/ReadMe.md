1. **Arduino Model**:  
   For this project, we utilized the **Arduino Uno R3**.

2. **Memory Limitations**:  
   The **32KB memory** on a single Arduino Uno R3 was insufficient for our source code, as it couldn't handle the full scope of the project.

3. **Solution - Dual Arduino Setup**:  
   To overcome this limitation, we opted to use **two Arduino Uno R3 boards** instead of just one. This setup provided the additional memory and processing capability required to run the project smoothly.
